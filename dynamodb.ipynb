    "# Working with Amazon DynamoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview and objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use Amazon DynamoDB to store and manage menu information. Using databases, such as DynamoDB, simplifies data management because I can easily query, sort, edit, and index data. I will use both the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to work with DynamoDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "In upcoming projects, I will use application programming interface (API) calls from the café website to dynamically retrieve and update data that's stored in a DynamoDB table. \n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this document, you should also be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new DynamoDB table \n",
    "- Add data to the table \n",
    "- Modify table items based on conditions \n",
    "- Query the table \n",
    "- Add a global secondary index to the table\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "When I started the simulation, the following resources are already created for Ithe AWS account:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment (IDE) instance\n",
    "- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance for authoring code and running commands through the AWS CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "![starting resources](images/DDB_start_lab.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lab, My achitecture will look like the following example:\n",

    "![starting resources](images/DDB_end_lab.png)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "The café website is up and running, and the café staff noticed a significant increase in new customer visits. Multiple customers also mentioned that it would be helpful if the website had an up-to-date menu. They could then use the menu to check the availability of food items before going to the café. \n",
    "\n",
    "Frank and Martha ask Sofía to explore whether she can implement this feature for customers. Sofía is feeling more confident in her coding skills and has also been learning about different ways to store information in AWS. She knows that before they can dynamically update data on the website, she must first choose a data storage service to hold the data. She also needs to learn how to manage table data, load the product records, and create scripts to retrieve information from the data platform.\n",

    "## A business request from the café: Store menu information in the cloud\n",
    "Frank and Martha mentioned to Sofía that they want the website to dynamically update its menu information. To prepare for this new functionality, Sofía decides to store this information in DynamoDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "Café staff must be able to retrieve information from the table. Sofía decides to create one script that retrieves all inventory items from the table and another script (as a proof of concept) that uses a product name to retrieve a single record.\n",

    "Tip: Choose Iprimary keys carefully. After a table has been created, Iannot change the primary key to use a different attribute or set of attributes.
